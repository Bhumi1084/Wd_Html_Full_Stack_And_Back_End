Q-12 : How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?

=> Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. 

=> They've been a feature of the Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web a web. 

=> Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of 
    documents, or make apps available at a web address.

=> A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <a> element and using 
    the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

=> Example : 
            <p>I'm creating a link to
                <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
            </p>
