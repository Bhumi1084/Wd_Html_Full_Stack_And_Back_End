Q-20 : What are logical and physical tags in HTML?

=> In HTML, tags can be categorized into logical (semantic) and physical (presentational) tags.

1. Logical (Semantic) Tags:
    -> Logical or semantic tags describe the meaning and structure of the content.

    -> They provide information about the role of the content within the document, which helps 
        search engines and assistive technologies understand and navigate the content better.

    -> They are important for accessibility, SEO, and proper document structure.

    -> Example : <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <a> etc.

2. Physical (Presentational) Tags:
    -> Physical or presentational tags are used to directly define the appearance of the content, 
        without providing any semantic meaning. 
        
    -> They are mainly concerned with how the content should look.

    -> Example : <tt>, <u>, <i>, <b>
