Q-5 : What are different types of lists in HTML?

=> there are several types of lists that you can use to organize and display items.
1. Ordered List (<ol>):
    -> This type of list is used for items that need to be displayed in a specific order.
    -> Items are typically numbered.
    -> Example:
        <ol>
            <li>First item</li>
            <li>Second item</li>
            <li>Third item</li>
        </ol>

2. Unordered List (<ul>):
    -> This type of list is used for items that do not need to be displayed in a specific order.
    -> Items are typically marked with bullets.
    -> Example:
        <ul>
            <li>First item</li>
            <li>Second item</li>
            <li>Third item</li>
        </ul>

3. Description List (<dl>):
    -> This type of list is used for pairs of terms and descriptions.
    -> It consists of <dt> (definition term) and <dd> (definition description) elements.
    -> Example:
        <dl>
            <dt>Term 1</dt>
            <dd>Description for term 1</dd>
            <dt>Term 2</dt>
            <dd>Description for term 2</dd>
        </dl>

4. Nested Lists:
    -> Lists can be nested inside each other to create sub-lists.
    -> Example with an unordered list nested inside an ordered list:
        <ol>
            <li>First item</li>
            <li>Second item
                <ul>
                    <li>Subitem 1</li>
                    <li>Subitem 2</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Third item</li>
        </ol>
