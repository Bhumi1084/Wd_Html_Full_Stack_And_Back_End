Q-10 : How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table?

=> The purpose of this article is to explore the method of merging table cells in HTML using the 
    rowspan and colspan attributes.

=> By utilizing rowspan, multiple cells in a row can be merged or combined, while colspan enables 
    the merging of cells in a column within an HTML table.

=> This technique proves essential for creating visually organized and structured tables, and 
    optimizing the presentation of data.

=> Example :

<html>
<body style="text-align:center" border=2px>
	<table align="center">
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Age</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>ABC</td>       <!-- This cell will take up space on two rows -->
			<td rowspan="2">44</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>XYZ</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</body>
</html>
