Q-1 : What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?

=> Common uses of a span tag include changing the style or color of a part of the text, 
    highlighting a section of text, and inserting icons or small graphics inline with text.

=> It's also useful for applying JavaScript actions to specific parts of inline content.

=> The <span> tag in HTML is an inline-level element used for styling and grouping content within 
    a web page. 
    
=> Unlike block-level elements like <div>, the <span> tag does not inherently introduce any 
    line breaks or block formatting. 
    
=> Instead, it allows you to target and style specific portions of text or inline elements without 
    disrupting the overall flow of the document.

=> Example :
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
                <title>Styling Text Example</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <p>
                    Welcome to <span style="color: blue;">Shiksha Online</span>, 
                    where learning <span style="color: green;">never stops</span>.
                </p>
            </body>
            </html>
