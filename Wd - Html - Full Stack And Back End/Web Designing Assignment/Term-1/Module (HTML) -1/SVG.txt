Q-1 : What is SVG?

=> SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is an XML-based markup language for describing 
    two-dimensional vector graphics. 

=> SVG allows for the creation of images that can be scaled to different sizes without losing 
    quality, making it ideal for responsive design on the web.

=> SVG supports interactivity and animation. You can add event listeners to SVG elements to make 
    them interactive.

=> SVG graphics can be styled with CSS, similar to how HTML elements are styled.

=> SVG files are often smaller in size compared to other image formats, especially for simple 
    graphics, because they are text-based and can be compressed effectively.

=> Example : 

    <svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
    </svg>
