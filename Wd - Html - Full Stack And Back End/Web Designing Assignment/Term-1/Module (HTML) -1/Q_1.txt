Q-1 : Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?

=> HTML Tags and Elements are sometimes perceived as the same. However, they are not.

=> There is a subtle difference between HTML elements and tags that many people aren't aware of.

=> In HTML, tags represent the structural components of a document, such as <h1> for headings.
    -> Example : <b> </b>

=> Elements are formed by tags and encompass both the opening and closing tags along with the content.
    -> Example : <b> This is the content. </b>

=> HTML tags are almost like keywords where every single tag has unique meaning.

=> HTML element spicifies the general content.
