Q-1 : What are HTML Entities?

=> An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;).

=> HTML entities are frequently used to display reserved characters and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). 

=> Some special characters are reserved for use in HTML, meaning that your browser will parse them as HTML code

=> To display these characters as text, replace them with their corresponding character entities.

=> Example : &nbsp;
             &copy;
             &reg;
