            purposes.

-> <section>: Represents a standalone section of content which is thematically related.

-> <header>: Defines the header for a section or page, typically containing introductory content 
                or navigational links.

                navigational links.
        
-> <nav>: Represents a section of the page intended for navigation links.

-> <aside>: Represents a section of the page with content that is tangentially related to the 
            content around it.
